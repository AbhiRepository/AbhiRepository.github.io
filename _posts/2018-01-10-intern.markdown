description: Intership at IIT Indore
---

For a long time i wanted to write my expirence as an intern at center of astronomy at IIT, Indore. So finally i got time so here it is. How i got this internship we'll cover that in some other blog, for this blog i'll just talk about the project i worked on.

So initially i was told that i was assign project to solve various fluid dynamics diffrential equation using python, but just few days before starting of internship professor called me that he had an awsome project related to deep learning ,as i already stated my will to work on machine learning. So this project was basically was on CNN to morphological classsify the simulated images of astrophysical with various signal to noise ratio. I was aware of what convolutional neural network back ten but never implemented it on any minor project forget about the making a huge model for big data set. But I wanted to work on machine learning project so i told him that i would like to work on it after asking few question on CNN and tensorflow (*and god I was so terified while answering cause I wasn't sure If all of them were right*) but in the end of call every thing went well i answered pretty much every question and told me that he'll send the relevent material.

Okay so after as i got off the phone and went to my room i slept as i was very sleppy at that time. after 6-7hr i woke up and totally forgot what i talked on the phone with the professor, continued watching 13 reason why!! net day morning i got an email from the professor he send me some research paper related to CNN, tranfer learning, image classificatio, astrophysical jet's and at that time my heart start sinking, all of a sudden my heart rate increase, i start remembering all the talk i had yesterday and i realised i am doomed as soon as i start reading the paper, i had no clue what i am reading out of hundred word i was able to understand only 30 words where remaining was just the helping word like {a, an, i, is ...}, i think it's just my bad english or something so i thought i'll give me sometime to get over the paper and it will be fine. So i have aroung 7 dya's remaining for start of my internship so i decide to read all that paper in a day or two i think that will be sufficent.
