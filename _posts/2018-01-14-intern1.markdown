Continuing my last blog post,
My internship started from 12th december, I reached there on the night of 11th. Next day woke up at 7am took a bath, *After a long time*. So after reaching the college I called professor and asked him for the direction for the is astronomy pod, he gave me direction but man that's a big college compare to our's. I spent like an hour or so finding the pod, and finally reached there. He greeted me warmly and he is one of the best professor I've ever seen, heard about. Literally my 4 year are totally doomed cause he set such a high benchmark as a mentor, I won't find anyone comparable to him. *So putting aside talk about professor let's get back to the blog*, so he introduced me to all the Phd student's and other professors, they all were pretty cool people. After talking with everyone he showed me my desk and then start explaing what I had to do in the project, I told him whatever I've know till now and showed him just a sample model I made, on sample dataset. He was pretty impressed with it, *Ahh finally those sleepless night finally paid off*. While doing my internship, alot of my prespective changed as before I thought in internship you were required to know every thing before hand, well you don't, you can learn while doing it and I learnt alot, it's been one of the most productive month in my student life.
