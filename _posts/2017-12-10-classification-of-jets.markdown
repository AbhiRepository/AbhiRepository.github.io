I have done this project as a intern at IIT Indore. In this project I've implement a convolutional neural network using transfer learning to classify simulated images of FRI and FRII astrophysical jet morphologicaly. 

Simulated images are made using matplotlib with random parameters and specific "signal to noise ratio".
